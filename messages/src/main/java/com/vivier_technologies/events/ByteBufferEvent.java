/**
 * Very basic naive implementation using standard java bytebuffer impl
 *
 * Will exhibit reasonable performance but need another implementation to go faster
 *
 * Methods marked as final for inlining
 *
 * No checking is deliberate - could think about adding checks based on system property later..
 *
 * Intended to be run single threaded so not worrying about padding to avoid false sharing etc
